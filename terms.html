  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Today’s Date]</p>
  <p><strong>Platform Name:</strong> DTech Services</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    DTech Services (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides a platform for students and individuals to list second-hand items for sale or rent. All transactions are managed by DTech Services. By using our website or services, you agree to these Terms & Conditions.
  </p>

  <h2>2. User Eligibility</h2>
  <p>
    You must be 18 years or older to use our services, or have permission from a parent/guardian if under 18. Users must provide accurate information and remain respectful on the platform.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Verification Requirements</h2>
  <p>
    All users who wish to list items must provide:
    <ul>
      <li>A valid South African ID or Student Card</li>
      <li>A clear photo of themselves (selfie)</li>
    </ul>
    This is required to confirm ownership and prevent fraud. Verification documents are stored securely and not shared without consent.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Ownership of Items</h2>
  <p>
    By listing an item, you confirm that you are the legal owner and have the right to sell or rent it. Fake, stolen, or prohibited items are strictly banned and may be reported to authorities.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Our Role</h2>
  <p>
    DTech Services acts as a middleman between sellers and customers. We manage the listing, communication, transactions, and delivery/handover process.
    <ul>
      <li>Buyers and renters transact directly with DTech Services.</li>
      <li>We pay sellers/renters after the item has been successfully handed over or delivered.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>6. Payments</h2>
  <p>
    Buyers make payments to DTech Services. Sellers or item owners will be paid:
    <ul>
      <li>After the item is delivered or picked up by the buyer/renter</li>
      <li>Minus a service fee (agreed upon before listing)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>7. Refunds and Returns</h2>
  <p>
    Refunds are considered on a case-by-case basis. If a buyer/renter receives an item that is not as described, damaged, or non-functional, they must report it within 24 hours.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Prohibited Items</h2>
  <p>
    The following items are strictly prohibited:
    <ul>
      <li>Stolen goods</li>
      <li>Counterfeit or fake products</li>
      <li>Illegal items (drugs, weapons, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>9. Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Your personal data (such as ID, student card, and photo) is kept confidential and is only used for verification. We do not sell or share your information with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    DTech Services is not responsible for damages or losses caused by users, theft, or misuse of the platform. Users are responsible for their own actions and listings.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>
    These terms may be updated at any time. Continued use of the platform after changes means you accept the updated terms.
